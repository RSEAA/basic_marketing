                <p>I am writing to you to offer a partnership opportunity for RSEAA24 that is scheduled from the 10th to the 13th of September 2024. This is a joint partnership between the RSE Asia Association and the RSE Australia New Zealand Association. This year’s theme is “Sharing tech architectures”.</p>
                <p>This is an event to ensure RSEs in Asia and Australia have a say on how they develop the community and to allow them to share their valuable technical and social knowledge of research software with the community.</p>
                <p>We contacted you because of XYZ.</p>
                <p>Would you be interested in partnering with us this year?</p>
                <p>You can find more information about partnerships in our prospectus that is attached.</p>
                <p>If you would like to support the community in other ways, you could share the details of RSEAA24 via your organisation’s mailing list and encourage attendance from any potential RSEs working for your organisation or people who work with RSEs.</p>
                <p>Please let me know if you would like to partner with us, or if you have any further ideas you can support the community, or if you have any comments or questions.</p>
